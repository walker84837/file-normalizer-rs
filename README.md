documentation updates, etc. Feel free to submit a PR or open an issue discussing
potential enhancements. Before contributing:

  - Follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  - Keep a consistent coding style. To make sure your coding style remains the
    same, format your code with:
    ``` console
    $ rustfmt --edition 2021 path/to/source_code
    ```
  - Use Rust stable, rather than Rust nightly.
  - If you have to use an external library, please use lightweight ones (ie.
    `ureq` over `reqwest`, `async-std` over `tokio`)
  - Prefer using the standard library over reinventing the wheel.

Please stick to Rust's official style guidelines while submitting patches.
